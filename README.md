# Single-hand-held bluetooth thumb keyboard

Because you've always wanted to use Vim in Tmux on your mobile while commuting by bus, right?

## Introduction

I hate on-screen keyboards. No amount of inovation or training brings it's typing experience anywhere close to the joy of using the good old Blackberry phone. Unfortunately number of hardware keyboard phones keeps decreasing. There are several variants of bluetooth thumb keyboards available but they always make some compromises which I don't like - some has to be held by both hands, some lacks special keys and chording keyboards turned out to be too difficult for me. In this desperation I decided to try to design my own perfect mobile keyboard.

## Evolution

At first I intended to create just minimalistic rectangle full of buttons that would fit in my hand but when I tested a cardboard form prototype I noticed it's not very convenient. I started to make adjustments which I again tested on a cardboard prototypes and soon several branches of promising designs evolved from these iterations. It was interesting how weird shapes came out when I judged them only by the ergonomics. Then I chose one of the designs and created a functional prototype.

## Key ideas

### Hybrid of thumb keyboard and chording keyboard

Thumb keyboards are simple to use but they would be too large for one hand if they contain all the buttons of full keyboard. Chording keyboards solve this but they require a long training and even then using them may be unpleasant. And both of them does not support simultaneous key presess, which are widely used on PC (Ctrl+c), very well.

I wanted to design primarily a thumb keyboard but I also want to put other fingers to work occasionally, just enough to achieve functional parity with full keyboard. Next idea is the key to this compromise.

### Physical and logical keypress inversion
