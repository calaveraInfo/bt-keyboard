# Single-hand-held bluetooth thumb keyboard

Because you've always wanted to use Vim in Tmux on your mobile while commuting by bus, right?

## Introduction

I hate on-screen keyboards. No amount of inovation or training brings it's typing experience anywhere close to the joy of using the good old Blackberry phone. Unfortunately number of hardware keyboard phones keeps decreasing. There are several variants of bluetooth thumb keyboards available but they always make some compromises which I don't like - some has to be held by both hands, some lacks special keys and chording keyboards turned out to be too difficult for me. In this desperation I decided to try to design my own perfect mobile keyboard.
